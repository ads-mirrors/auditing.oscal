Uniform Resource Identifier Overview According to RFC 3986, a URI has the following syntax, which is represented in Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) below.
URI = scheme &amp;#34;:&amp;#34; hier-part [ &amp;#34;?&amp;#34; query ] [ &amp;#34;#&amp;#34; fragment ] hier-part = &amp;#34;//&amp;#34; authority path-abempty / path-absolute / path-rootless / path-empty The scheme and path components are required, though the path may be empty (no characters).</description></item><item><title>OSCAL Content Examples</title><link>https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/learn/concepts/examples/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 May 2021 10:55:53 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/learn/concepts/examples/</guid><description>The OSCAL content repository on GitHub provides many examples of OSCAL formatted data including both actual data and mockups for demonstration.</description></item><item><title>Relations to Other Documentary Encoding Standards</title><link>https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/learn/concepts/relations-to-other/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Oct 2019 17:41:35 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/learn/concepts/relations-to-other/</guid><description>Professionals working in the security domain are already familiar with numerous standards, specifications, guidelines and regulatory frameworks that define and describe practice in the systems security arena: NIST SP800-53, ISO 27002, FedRAMP, FISMA/FIPS, HIPAA and others. OSCAL's models are designed to capture the full range of these.
However, OSCAL is not the only text encoding technology available, and it is not always the most suitable, depending on the task at hand.</description></item></channel></rss>
