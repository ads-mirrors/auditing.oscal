Before reading this tutorial you should:
Have some familiarity with the XML, JSON, or YAML formats. Have a basic understanding of the OSCAL models and their overall structure. Document metadata in OSCAL appears in two locations:
The document's universally unique identifier (UUID). The document's metadata section.

Feature requests can be created and submitted directly into the project's GitHub repository. Feedback in the form of bug reports are also encouraged and appreciated. If appropriate, we ask you add a comment to an existing relevant issue, and only create a new issue when no relevant issue exists.</description></item><item><title>Extending OSCAL Models</title><link>https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/learn/tutorials/general/extension/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Jul 2022 15:55:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/learn/tutorials/general/extension/</guid><description>This tutorial describes the mechanisms for extending basic OSCAL models. Before reading this tutorial, you should:
Have some familiarity with the XML, JSON, or YAML formats. Review the OSCAL Layers and Models documentation. Review the latest OSCAL Reference. What are the OSCAL Extension Mechanisms? OSCAL is designed with the goal of simultaneously supporting multiple cybersecurity frameworks. The core OSCAL syntax achieves this goal by focusing on properties that are universal or have applicability across various frameworks.</description></item><item><title>Model Overview</title><link>https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/learn/concepts/layer/overview/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Oct 2020 14:42:01 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/learn/concepts/layer/overview/</guid><description>OSCAL is organized in a series of layers that each provide a set of models.
A model represents a information structure supporting a specific operational purpose or concept.
Each model is comprised of information structures that form an information model for each OSCAL model. This information model is then bound to multiple serialization formats (i.e., XML, JSON, YAML), which represent a concrete data model. Thus, a data model that defines how to represent an OSCAL information model in a serialized format.</description></item><item><title>Creating a Profile</title><link>https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/learn/tutorials/control/basic-profile/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 May 2023 21:53:22 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/learn/tutorials/control/basic-profile/</guid><description>This tutorial covers creating and modifying a subset of controls from a catalog in OSCAL by using the OSCAL profile model.

implementation of security controls within information systems. OSCAL standardizes the format for documentation of security controls, while establishing a framework for the automated assessment of information systems to be evaluated based the state of the security controls being addressed.
How Does OSCAL Help Me? Reduces the amount of manual labor need to assess the implementation of controls.</description></item><item><title>For Baseline Authors</title><link>https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/about/stakeholders/contentcreators/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jun 2019 20:12:36 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/about/stakeholders/contentcreators/</guid><description>Systems security policy professionals who set requirements for security programs, both across and within organizations and agencies OSCAL provides a standardized solution for building security baselines, through the use of OSCAL profiles, that set the expectations for control implementation within one or more programs and associated information systems.
How Does OSCAL Help Me? Ensures consistency of control implementation across the enterprise. Improves the transparency of policy implementation by automating reviews of security control implementation and assessments.</description></item><item><title>For Security Professionals</title><link>https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/about/stakeholders/securitypros/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jun 2019 20:12:36 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/about/stakeholders/securitypros/</guid><description>Security professionals who document or implement security controls within information systems. OSCAL provides a standardized format for documenting security and privacy controls that maps across multiple compliance frameworks (i.e. NIST, PCI, etc.) and a method for attesting to the implementation of the controls within information systems
How Does OSCAL Help Me? Enables continuous maintenance of control documentation within a framework designed for that purpose. Reduces the amount of paperwork required to implement multiple compliance frameworks.</description></item><item><title>For Tool Developers</title><link>https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/about/stakeholders/tooldevelopers/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jun 2019 20:12:36 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/about/stakeholders/tooldevelopers/</guid><description>Tool developers who build security compliance systems (Electronic Governance Risk and Compliance [eGRC] systems), or who provide secure infrastructure/software solutions to the Federal Government or to highly regulated industries OSCAL provides standardized formats for consuming control, catalog, profile, and implementation information to visualize and automate security compliance processes. OSCAL provides a standardized means for the automated assessment of infrastructure and software solutions to verify the ongoing effectiveness of the system's security control implementation.</description></item><item><title>OSCAL Profile Resolution</title><link>https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/learn/concepts/processing/profile-resolution/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/learn/concepts/processing/profile-resolution/</guid><description>Notice of Draft Status Please note that this specification is currently a work in progress and is subject to change. If you have any feedback or comments, please create an issue at the NIST OSCAL Github Repository: github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL.
Abstract This specification provides the minimal requirements for processing an OSCAL Profile to create a new OSCAL Catalog Document. This process of applying a profile to a catalog to create a new catalog is called Profile Resolution.</description></item></channel></rss>
